All right, folks, today it's a crew show. Me and Zach are talking about many things. We're talking about hydrogen. We're talking about wind power. No, not wind generators. Sailboat racing, right? We're talking about my first impressions of the Polaris Slingshot. And we're answering a big question from last week's podcast. What are some cars that look light but are heavy? And what are some cars that you think might be heavy but are actually surprisingly light? It's a cruise show. Welcome to the Smoking Tire podcast. Here we go. Welcome to the Smoking Tire podcast with a slightly chilled caffeinated beverage. Here you go.

Speaker 1 | 00:42.483
Thank you.

Speaker 0 | 00:43.484
All right.

Speaker 1 | 00:44.545
28 minutes in. This'll really get going. Right.

Speaker 0 | 00:47.567
The second half of the show is really gonna pick up. Like VTEC.

Speaker 1 | 00:51.794
Exactly.

Speaker 0 | 00:52.254
VTEC will kick in eventually. Alright, I have eight things to talk about on today's program.

Speaker 1 | 01:00.536
Okay, I've looked up a bunch of cars because someone posed a question on the last show asking what are some cars that are surprisingly light and surprisingly heavy.

Speaker 0 | 01:10.077
Yeah, I have that as number eight.

Speaker 1 | 01:12.478
Oh, okay. So, you drove a...

Speaker 0 | 01:14.198
I want to build up suspense to that.

Speaker 1 | 01:16.579
Stick around for the second half of the show.

Speaker 0 | 01:17.939
So, the riveting math that will happen. right around when the Celsius kicks in.

Speaker 1 | 01:22.740
It's called engagement.

Speaker 0 | 01:23.901
Item number one is I want to talk about the watch giveaway. It's on Instagram, go to the teal on the right. We have the details and the game is active from now until December 1. You have to enter. I said I was going to do this and we now have the formula and here we go. It's on the Instagram, go check it out if you like. The giveaway, the prize, right? One-of-one prototype Notice Canyon watch. The dial is dark teal. It is the only one. It's the one that we made to see which final colors we would do. Serial number on the back is XXX out of 100. So it is a prototype. It's final. It works. It's a real watch, but it's the only one. I won't even have one. That's cool. I could have kept this one if I wanted, but I didn't. We're doing a giveaway. So you can win one. You can win this watch. We sold a hundred of the mint green in an hour. A lot of people wanted but couldn't get. This is the opportunity to get one. There is no purchase necessary. There are three ways to enter this contest to win this watch. And the prize, by the way, isn't just the watch. If you live in North America, which Mexico and Canada are included, you will get the watch. I will fly you to Los Angeles to collect it from me in person. I will put you up in a hotel. I will. pay for your airfare, I will take you to Kogi Taqueria to experience authentic Los Angeles food, we'll have a Korean burrito together, and I will take you in the canyons in any one of my cars that you choose. Okay? It's the whole deal. If you are international, I'm not buying your flight. But I'll do everything else. If you want to come to LA, I will do everything else besides buy your international plane ticket. Otherwise, I will ship you the watch anywhere in the world. Okay? I cannot be responsible for what happens. to it if you live in fucking Syria or something. If you live in Russia and you win, best of luck, I'll send you the tracking number, maybe it'll show up. So that is the prize. Watch and a trip to LA to collect it if you live in North America. To enter, there's three things you can do. One is you can sign up for Be The Match. You can go to bethematch.org and sign up via their website to be a stem cell and bone bone marrow donor. The sign-up process is very easy. They will send you a kit with a little cheek swabber thing. You swab your cheek, you send it back in, you get put on the registry. When you send the cheek swab back in and they send you a confirmation email saying you're now on the registry, you forward that to us and you're entered. Okay, that's option one. You are now on the registry. You are now on the registry. Cannot do that method if you're over 41 years old. I'm sorry that is for the youth the youths as it were Okay, we need the blood boys to other people two other options. You can go donate blood or platelets, okay? And if you go do that you go to your local hospital the Red Cross wherever you do that locally pick a spot I don't give a shit get documentation of your donation a receipt and Some photo you know a photo of you with today's newspaper or something, indicating that you're doing this blood donation and that you're real, okay? You can do this multiple times between now and September. I don't know what the limit is, but if you donate blood multiple times, it's multiple entries. It might be like every 90 days or something. I don't know if they'll actually allow it, but if you can, do. Oh, and by the way, regarding Be the Match, if you signed up for Be the Match any time in 2023, send me that confirmation. You're good. That's an entry. The idea of the game is to get new people to register. And I had a couple emails from people that were like, I registered in 2021. What do I do? And I appreciate that you registered. You're a good human. But the point is to drive new registrations. But if you did register in 2023, I will count it. Or donate blood or platelets. Each donation should be a separate email, separate documentation. But that counts as money. multiple, as many entries as you can do. Option three, some people emailed me and said for one reason or another, they're too old for Be The Match and a physical condition prevents them from donating blood. They have a blood disease or whatever. In that case, if you make a donation of $100 or more to Be The Match through their website and send me the receipt, that's an entry. The idea isn't to do that one. I really want you to do the other ones. I prefer you did the other ones. It's the idea that we have a national blood and platelet shortage. You can really save someone's life if you're chosen by Be The Match to be a donor. I'm a donor nine times out of ten, not be a donor. drilling into your bones for bone marrow. It's a blood draw for stem cells. It's very painless and easy. My wife did it twice. But if you can't do option one, you can't do option two. Option three, $100 or more donation, and then send in the receipt. And I will check with them to make sure that these are real. I know what a real confirmation email looks like. I know what a real receipt looks like. We're trying to do something good. But don't be a shithead and try and cheat this to win a fucking watch.

Speaker 1 | 07:08.669
You don't know Photoshopper form.

Speaker 0 | 07:10.310
Yeah, I mean, it's just, you know, we're trying to do something good here. Play for real or don't play, you know. Multiple monetary donations do not count. Only multiple blood donations count. Okay? And we have an email address set up. It's on the Instagram. It is peaceuniqueatthesmokingtire.com. P-I-E-C-E-U-N-I-Q-U-E. P-I-E-C-E-U-N-I-Q-U-E. PeaceUnique at thesmokingtire.com. Zach, will you please copy and paste all these into the show notes for this episode later? So I'll have multiple posts up. The Be The Match process does take a couple weeks. From signing up to getting the kit, to sending it back, to getting confirmation, that takes a couple of weeks. And the deadline is December 1st, 2023. So don't wait until the middle of November to do this. If you're gonna do the Be The Match one, do it now. Get the process going. And somebody will, oh yeah, and a commenter on this says, "'Can we choose the Delica if we win?' Yes, we can go in the canyons in the Delica, but Hannah gets to drive you if you win.

Speaker 1 | 08:19.613
So yeah. That's a way to extend the trip and the time with you by several hours.

Speaker 0 | 08:24.234
By a long time, yeah. So anyway, that's the game, that's the prize. Please do the blood stuff if you are physically able to. That's really what I want you to do. I only added option three for people that are physically unable To do the blood stuff. I've donated blood. I'm also on be the match I'm not a not a hypocrite as is my entire family so As am I and I did I did the playlist a couple times like you can get to watch movies and TV And they bring you Gatorade.

Speaker 1 | 08:56.225
It's not a big deal. It's not a bad time. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 08:58.666
it's actually quite relaxing Just make sure you eat first make sure you eat first make sure you definitely eat first and don't be hungry hungover. Besides those things, you're good to go. The watch is beautiful. The only reason we didn't make the teal is because I liked the other two colors better, but it's certainly a standout watch. And when you come to LA to collect it, if you win, it'll be at the event where everyone who bought the mint green one will be collecting their watches. So everyone will be collecting the watches that they paid for and had to jump through a hoop to fucking get. All pro drivers, by the way, and you're going to get the only one. one that is a different color and that'll be very very cool. So that's the game you can read those the rules they're up on my Instagram and and yeah it's a it's a it's gonna be a very cool thing.

Speaker 1 | 09:47.090
This is a great thing. It's a good idea.

Speaker 0 | 09:48.751
It's a good game right?

Speaker 1 | 09:50.092
Yeah but it's a good thing you're doing.

Speaker 0 | 09:51.453
Yeah yeah I think it's a good idea. The be the match people are stoked and the game is in honor of the memory of John Stein who lost his battle with cancer with leukemia but who got probably two years due to a stem cell match and transplant. So that's that. That's item number one. Check. Item number two is go down second row left. The Brekkie Car Club event at Westside Collector Car Storage South Bay.

I took down the box from the top shelf of my closet, marked 38 jeans, and I put on smaller pants, and they fit.

Speaker 1 | 12:15.360
Dude, you are losing weight.

Speaker 0 | 12:16.080
It took six fucking months, but I've lost four inches on my waist.

Speaker 1 | 12:23.081
Sarah saw your Brekkie Card Club Instagram video last night because I was watching it, and she was like, whoa, he's lost weight.

Speaker 0 | 12:29.202
Yeah, I don't know how much, but pants that start with a three. That's all. Awesome. And only one X on the shirt.

Speaker 1 | 12:36.926
And it's loose on you.

Speaker 0 | 12:38.568
XL shirt, not 2XL. It's got space. Mmm! Proud of that.

Speaker 1 | 12:45.042
You should be proud of that.

Speaker 0 | 12:45.902
It's hard. Yeah, it's hard. You want to talk about the ISF? We can go to ISF. Sure. And then I'll come back.

Speaker 1 | 12:53.743
I want to promote two of our videos. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 12:55.504
we have the supercharged ISF that's up, Porsche 959 video's up. We talked about the 959 already.

Speaker 1 | 13:01.245
We did talk about the 959.

Speaker 0 | 13:02.965
Not a lot of views on the 959. Not bad,

Speaker 1 | 13:05.606
but not huge.

Speaker 0 | 13:06.666
Considering it's not why I was in Germany, yeah, but like, you know, it's a 959.

Speaker 1 | 13:11.107
SEO,

Speaker 0 | 13:11.707
older car. I would have thought a little more, but okay. No one's really saying anything. in 959? I guess. Go watch a 959 video, please.

Speaker 1 | 13:18.469
I do want to drive one someday.

Speaker 0 | 13:19.970
But what about the supercharged ISF? Sticker license plate, very good.

Speaker 1 | 13:25.172
Totally surprised me in how well it handled and felt compared to when it was stock. We had a press car back in the day, as did everybody, and it rode like garbage. I remember being so surprised at how quickly it would light up tires and step out, not because I was trying so hard. Way too stiff, and so when I was doing research about the car, Lexus, they had two versions, 08 to 2011, they set the car up super low, because it looked good and it lived well over the center of gravity, but then they had to have really firm springs so you don't ride the bump stops the whole time, which contributed to it riding like shit. 2011, they literally changed every suspension component and no review was that impressed with it, even with that, it was like, just, the ride was unrefined, too stiff, everything wrong with it. for, not just for being a Lexus, like it's a sports car, sure, but compared to C63 at the time, or the M3 at the time, like E90 rides really nice, handles well. But this dude did Ohlins with custom Swiss springs on it, and it was like the perfect Canyon suspension setup. We were on Big Tohonga. Yeah, Big Tohonga.

Speaker 0 | 14:36.420
That photo's Big Tohonga,

Speaker 1 | 14:37.101
yeah. And it was like, those little bumps that are there, it just soaked them up, didn't lose grip, it was so good. And of course, it's supercharged, and running. E85 monster it's like 800 at the wheels or 700 at the wheels Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 14:50.149
you go through like three tanks of gas.

Speaker 1 | 14:52.192
Did he bring extra 85 he did he? He did yeah, I think he did cuz yeah a friend with him who? also at an ISF, and they had a can. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 15:02.278
they've always got extra. You never know when you're gonna run out. That's the problem with the E85.

Speaker 1 | 15:06.159
Totally, I mean, we're way up there, and you could just run out there.

Speaker 0 | 15:07.919
You could just run out at any time.

Speaker 1 | 15:09.159
That's what I don't like about it. I understand, I mean, the power you get is amazing, but it can be very inconvenient. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 15:15.941
that's why I like my Octane booster way better than E85. It's just way easier to carry extra, you know.

Speaker 1 | 15:23.402
I wonder if someone could get the same power engine to engine. I mean,

Speaker 0 | 15:28.023
that's a chemical question. E85 is typically. comparable to a race gas tune, to a 100 octane tune. So I think you probably could. Guys, I gotta take a quick break from the action for NASCAR. Some other action in this episode of The Smoking Tire is brought to you by NASCAR. The playoffs are heating up as drivers head to Bristol for a Saturday night showdown under the lights as the field will be trimmed from six to 12 playoff drivers in the elimination race presented by Xfinity.

Speaker 1 | 18:35.990
Ooh. Was Boostain- I mean,

Speaker 0 | 18:37.431
it's depending where you- if you live somewhere, you know, like, 20% off. Nebraska or something where 85 is common it grows on the way cheaper like it's like cheaper than gas Yeah, and you get a lot more power so like I get that versus but here Yes, I'm what I hear you. It's hard to get a 85 where did this guy come from with his? Orange oh so down there. They've got a little more.

Speaker 1 | 18:57.893
They have more yeah. Yeah, but rad Great like fast handle it sounds like a Mustang 5-liter v8, but like it sounds exactly like a loud Mustang and Transmission, though, it's the only downside. Because some of the, there are aspects to cars that you can upgrade where they feel, let's say modern. You're like, oh, this rides as good as a new car using MagRide technology. But then you shift, and even if they change the programming and the transmission or whatever, it's just not like a DCT. It's decent, but the M3 would always win the contest because it has a DCT or a manual. But otherwise, man, like. We know so many people that have these that put miles on them, they don't break. Freddie bought that one with like 200,000 miles or something on it and it was fine. Like if all you want is a fast E90 or C63 and you don't wanna fix it all the time, this car is awesome. It just needs suspension and then it's magic. I mean it feels super tight. So go watch that video, listen to it, see all the parts that are on it. There's a ton done to this thing and it gets lively.

Speaker 0 | 20:06.661
Cool. I went sailboat racing.

Speaker 1 | 20:10.027
You did? That's right.

Speaker 0 | 20:10.728
Yeah. It was fucking awesome. I went out with this dude, Hunter, who, um... came to look at WCCS possibly for one of his cars and then we talked about sailboats and he was like, you know, I do this. I was like, I've wanted to do this. So he invited me out with his team.

Speaker 1 | 20:27.147
Did you ask him about the crack and the prostitutes? Yeah. What? Hunter Biden.

Speaker 0 | 20:31.528
Oh, sorry, I missed that. It's okay. That's funny, I don't spend my time thinking about Hunter Biden. How about that? You don't,

Speaker 1 | 20:38.329
I have a poster of him on my wall. He's on my wishboard or whatever it's called.

Speaker 0 | 20:44.711
He and his father own a beautiful boat. I think it's like 42 feet maybe. There's a photo of it on my Instagram if you go down a little bit. Yeah, if you go through that, there's a little slideshow that shows the boat. They've got a pretty beautiful boat. They've got a pretty serious team. They were contending for the championship. Every Wednesday all summer, 22 races in the season. It's the longest regatta, from what I hear, in America. 85 boats started this race. 85 fucking yachts. We get out there for the start, I'm like, holy shit.

Speaker 1 | 21:24.585
They start all in one line?

Speaker 0 | 21:26.527
So it's like endurance racing, there's classes. So there were seven classes. And they start them from fast and then work their way to slow. So we were in one of the Cruising A, I think it's called, or Cruising One. And it's like for boats that have full cabins. And there's boats out there that are racing boats. They're maybe 40 or 50 feet, but they really don't have like a below deck. They're for racing. And I saw, we saw boats and the guys were like, oh yeah, that guy built that boat for this racing series.

Speaker 1 | 21:59.946
Whoa.

Speaker 0 | 22:00.466
So if you like take this shit really seriously, um, these guys take it pretty seriously considering the fact that the boat is a car. a cruising boat. It's a fast cruising boat. We saw over nine knots, but it has bedrooms and a kitchen and shit like that.

Speaker 1 | 22:16.965
You got a lot of lean here, right? You guys are all sitting on that side.

Speaker 0 | 22:19.126
It was windy, dude. It was fucking blowing like 15 to 17 knots, which for a boat like this is windy. Above 20, you have to start trimming in sail. You can't run full sail. Like 17, that's a big wind.

Speaker 1 | 22:29.570
If you run full sail, does it tip over or would it tear the sail or?

Speaker 0 | 22:33.812
It could get dangerous. Totally capsized because the keel has a lot of weight in it, but it's certainly not fast beyond a certain angle of lean It gets both very uncomfortable and very inefficient.

Speaker 1 | 22:47.870
It makes sense because there's less surface area displacing the right,

Speaker 0 | 22:50.512
right? So we this was like about as windy as it could be while running full sail. So You know, I showed up and I have a lot of experience sailing, but I've never been on this boat I've never met any of these people except the one guy so like no ego I was like, hey, I can do this. I can do this. but I don't know how certain specifics of this boat work. So I was like, if you want me to be ballast, like just sit on the high side and watch, no problem. I'm just happy to be here. You want me to turn a winch? Fine. And they were like, actually we're one short, so can you help with this? So I actually did get a little bit of a job. But, you know, team sport, sailing, fucking enough time between things where you have time to sort of chat and joke around. about and take pictures and and have fun and but also there's enough going on that you're never sitting still for too long. I got really wet. Yeah I mean because I was on four deck crew which is up front with the Spinnaker and sitting on the high side as ballast so like it was big waves so I was just getting just got just got hammered with water. But like these guys are really um you know they're they're all very pretty talented and they've got a lot of experience. got like a procedure and I'm 100% on this fucking team for next year. Cool. I was like every time, every race I can make I'm gonna make, assuming I will be invited back which it seems like I will. And really nice group of people. We finished, oh I don't know if I have a photo. We finished second in this race but by like, by a lot. 10 seconds, which in an hour and 20 minute sailboat race, 10 seconds is not much. And what's cool about sailboat racing that is different from car racing is the course is like a start line, and then a point, and then another point, and then a finish line. you can get to those points however you want, especially the upwind leg. The upwind leg, you have to go back and forth because you can't sail into the wind. So there is literally an infinite number of strategies for that.

Speaker 1 | 25:09.809
Like how frequently you want to tack, all that stuff.

Speaker 0 | 25:11.290
Yeah, the downwind legs, you pretty much just point at it and set your sails and make some adjustments. But the upwind leg is like, do you go one big move out and back? Do you do little moves in the middle? Do you, you know, what do you do? What does everyone else do? You know, and so there's a lot of strategy. And the strategy at the start is crazy because basically, you know, there's a countdown and it starts at like 25 minutes. And then all the boats, you can go wherever as long as you don't cross the start line until the gun.

Speaker 1 | 25:44.310
So I can like move around. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 25:46.070
you're not just sitting there you you fucking sail drag race. No, no No, you sail around and we take a little monster You gotta swim and as you as you get closer to the gun the boats get closer and closer and closer to the line And you're trying to end you and you know by the time the gun goes off you're like eight ten boats just lined up I see it's intense dude with fucking huge-ass yachts,

Speaker 1 | 26:05.235
right? It's and ten seconds by the way and knots you're moving 15 feet per second So you were only a hundred and fifty feet from the other boat, which seems quite close.

Speaker 0 | 26:16.095
We're closer than that a bunch of times. There were times where we were like, 15 feet from another boat. Yeah, it's rad. So fun, I had the best time fucking ever. The boat is called Spirit of California. Go follow them on Instagram, I tagged them. It's Spirit of CA. That's the boat's, there's a better picture of the boat. Look how pretty that boat is. I mean, you wanna talk about a beautiful ass fucking boat. That is a stunning sailboat. 2004, that boat was built. Wow, and nine knots on a boat. boat like that is moving. That's a fast fucking boat for what it is.

Speaker 1 | 26:54.585
That's cool. I like it, just simple. Dude,

Speaker 0 | 26:56.286
check out the spinnaker with Edvard Munch's The Scream on it. That's awesome. Flying spinnaker downwind. And then if you go back to my page, we did, on the downwind leg, we used the pole. And occasionally, I just had to be fat. They were like, we need weight. And I would go out.

Speaker 1 | 27:14.934
You're like, I lost weight.

Speaker 0 | 27:15.954
Yeah, still heaviest. So keep going. One more, two more. So right there, I'm literally just hanging on the pole to hold that sail out in the downward leg.

Speaker 1 | 27:28.619
Oh, I thought you were just hanging out. No, no,

Speaker 0 | 27:30.440
that's me holding that sail out. I'm actually being active there. Oh wow. That's active ballast. That's all core work. And then see on the screens on the mast, the telemetry of what we're doing? So right there, we were doing 6.8 knots in an eight knot wind, which is awesome.

Speaker 1 | 27:48.687
Very efficient. Awesome.

Speaker 0 | 27:49.628
Awesome, yeah.

Speaker 1 | 27:51.148
What is max efficiency, like carbon fiber, Oracle, tax write-off boat?

Speaker 0 | 27:55.790
Oh dude, SailGP boats. Have you seen the SailGP boats? Those boats are doing 45 knots in a 20 knot wind. Whoa! Those are foil boats. Have you seen,

Speaker 1 | 28:05.414
just Google a SailGP.

Speaker 0 | 28:06.694
They rise out of the water. Yeah, yeah, they're flying. They're much more like planes than they are like sailboats.

Speaker 1 | 28:11.896
That's amazing. They can multiply the speed, that's cool.

Speaker 0 | 28:14.377
I have no interest in sailing one of those. I wanna watch that race, but like I love. I mean this is this is some real fucking white guy shit racing yachts, you know, but like But like there's there's so much to it There's probably more like there's probably more to this than there than to racing cars Because there's so many things you can change about the boat while not changing other things. Yeah. I mean, you're constantly adjusting sales. You're constantly adjusting. you know, you're lying, you're constantly...

Speaker 1 | 28:50.360
In car terms, it would be like back in the day when you could adjust timing manually while driving. Because you're racing a car, you can't change the engine. Okay, you can change level one, two, three, like in F1, but any other car, it's like the engine's on and you control it with the throttle. But this is almost like, well, your spinnaker's an engine, your mainsail's an engine, your angle is like, yeah, all that stuff.

Speaker 0 | 29:09.919
And also, because there isn't a... you know, on a racetrack, it's the racetrack's 40 feet wide. There's always so many places you can go. Always so many places anyone else can go. But on the sea, when you guys are all tacking back and forth to try and get to the upwind leg. you can adjust your position anywhere on the sea based on where your competitors are, and you can also use right-of-way rules to your advantage. So, like, there's right-of-way in racing so you don't crash into each other. And so it gets a little complicated, but if the wind is coming off the, if you're on what's called the starboard tack, which means the wind is coming over the right side of your boat and hitting the sails, you have the right of way versus someone who's on the port tack, which is the wind coming the other way. So if you guys are fucking, if they've chosen a line and you can tack around, you can literally block them by using right of way rules. And so they're doing that shit all the time. Yeah. And you have to like round the marker a certain direction and like, you know, it's cool stuff. There's a lot of like, like this dude in the photo on the right, the bill, the guy standing. up to the right, he's tactician. So he didn't like, he's not, I mean he is doing physical things, but he's also, he's telling the guy driving the boat what to do. He's telling the guys managing the sails what to do, like he's the strategist. Got it. And the guy at the bottom there, Hunter, leaning on the cabin with the white hat on, that's his boat, and then his dad is sitting at the back there.

Speaker 1 | 30:49.414
So is there a captain or is like, or is the tactician... Is that what you said?

Speaker 0 | 30:53.596
The tactician is in charge of the team during the race. Okay. Yeah. And sometimes the tactician has a physical job and sometimes they don't. Sometimes he, tactician, will also drive the boat, but I think the guy's name was Brendan, who is physically steering there. He wanted to, it was like his first time in that job. He usually had the job I got at Fordec, but they moved him to driver, and so I got his job. So, he's raised and lowered the spinnaker, fly the pole, and he's got the job. and make sure the jib would get back and forth cleanly during the tax. Fucking cool stuff.

Speaker 1 | 31:27.890
That's very cool. Yeah. I thought sailing was boring when I was a kid. I did it like twice. But now if I have something to do, and it's very interesting, I don't get seasick, all that stuff.

Speaker 0 | 31:37.553
It's boring if you're not on the boat. If you're on the boat, it's fun.

Speaker 1 | 31:41.275
I mean, I was bored when I was a kid because I was just like, I wanted to go fast. But now I also really appreciate moving with wind instead of motors, ironically. It's really cool.

Speaker 0 | 31:50.699
If the wind sucks, then sailing is cool. is boring.

Speaker 1 | 31:54.580
If it's boring enough, it turns into rowing.

Speaker 0 | 31:56.621
Going fast completely changes the game. If you're going fast on a boat and harnessing the wind to do so, then it becomes very fun. And you can get really, they're calling it 8.7, 8.8. When you cross 9, it was a very exciting moment. It's not easy to cross 9 on a sailboat like that. And some of the really fast boats were going 12, 13, which is fast.

Speaker 1 | 32:21.231
What is that in miles per hour?

Speaker 0 | 32:22.532
Hill, it's 1.2, so it's like 16, 17 miles an hour. But a 60-foot sailboat going that pace is pretty quick.

Speaker 1 | 32:31.239
Grossman, there we go. Yeah, I dig it. I went rock climbing this week for the first time in like six years. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 32:41.531
your arms feel like they're going to fall off?

Speaker 1 | 32:42.711
Oh, they've been sore like calves if you hike 10 miles. That's how my forearms have felt for two days. But I bring it up because of the tactician and figuring out how you want to get across the water. It's rad because you also have all these holds and you can do a different way than someone else depending on your ability, their ability. I really enjoy the problem solving side of it.

Speaker 0 | 33:01.815
I remember the Alex Honnold thing and his like... map up El Capitan.

Speaker 1 | 33:05.996
I think that you can only do one way. And he did it the same way every time. That's why he's alive.

Speaker 0 | 33:10.158
If you want to do it without ropes, I think you can only do it one way.

Speaker 1 | 33:12.839
Yeah, don't get creative. Yeah.

Speaker 0 | 33:15.180
That's rad. But go follow Spirit of CA on Instagram. My other job was to get them an audience. They need some followers for that boat. You'll get beautiful sailing pictures. That's what you'll get in your feed. And then there's the team that I did not, I didn't, they invited me to stay and party with them after the race. I didn't. feel like I had really earned that. Plus I rode a motorcycle there, which is... No drinky. Yeah, no drinky for sure. And also I had to ride home in wet jeans, which sucked.

Speaker 1 | 33:49.674
Yeah, it's summertime, but it's not that warm. No, it was cold.

Speaker 0 | 33:52.995
It was cold and wet. Speaking of alternative powers, remember the guy that I posted on Instagram with five Toyota Mira? in his driveway?

Speaker 1 | 34:05.404
No, but someone brought that up in our questions today, our Patreon questions, so I'm wondering what that's about.

Speaker 0 | 34:09.576
So I had drinks with that guy. He found me, he invited me over, I went over to his crib and we talked about hydrogen.

Speaker 1 | 34:17.035
Wait, does he live down the street?

Speaker 0 | 34:18.337
He lives in my neighborhood. Okay. Yeah, yeah, he lives in my neighborhood. Okay. And so it turns out he knows some of my friends. He knows Ben from Avance magazine. Ben, Ben, Seattle Ben. And uh... And so, yeah, this guy, totally unsurprisingly, works in the hydrogen business. He runs a non-profit, I believe it's called H2Go. I think. Maybe I should have asked that. He runs a nonprofit that is basically responsible for promoting the use of hydrogen in California. It was started by Schwarzenegger and his team, back when Schwarzenegger was governor. They do commercial and consumer hydrogen. They're responsible for the build-out of hydrogen stations. There's been some hurdles with that, which he recalls your experience getting involved. getting stranded at the Harris Ranch when they ran out. He had some thoughts on that. But he also is kind of like me in that he personally would rather implement much easier but less sexy solutions to some of our problems using hydrogen that could be done like today. Like his other focus is like on the port of Los Angeles, where there are tens of thousands of trucks, not to mention forklifts, generators, and other heavy machinery that could easily be converted. So, he's got a lot of ideas. converted to hydrogen right fucking now. And really drastically improved the air quality in Long Beach and San Pedro. Because right now there's so much diesel down there, and you could convert every forklift. And when the ships come in to port, they can't run their engines, right? Once they're, I believe, within five miles ashore, they have to switch from their nasty bunker fuel to clean gas. So that was a law. Did you know that? So they made a law. in California that any ships coming to the port have to have a second tank of clean gas. Because bunker fuel, what they burn is like some nasty,

Speaker 1 | 36:21.518
nasty- It's like oil sludge, right?

Speaker 0 | 36:22.900
It's the dirtiest gas on the planet. So they have to switch to the clean gas to get within shore. And he said the chart- The air quality chart, the day they implemented that law, it was like a hockey stick. Instant. Instant change in Southern California air quality. It was a total no-brainer. But then, when they dock, they have to connect to shore power. Sometimes, in the summer, when the grid is stressed, that shore power is diesel fucking generators. So those could be converted to hydrogen instantly. You could have a filling station at the port.

Speaker 1 | 37:02.991
All those. But instantly you have to change the engines and everything, right? Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 0 | 37:06.791
but nothing new needs to be invented and you don't need 10,000 people to buy cars and you don't need any laws.

Speaker 1 | 37:13.733
Because the other side of that, you also don't need giant batteries and all the precious metals that come with it, which is the benefit. Right, right,

Speaker 0 | 37:19.394
yeah, and you don't need to change the procedure of filling the generators with fuel or whatever, you just, you do. the same thing, the procedures would all be fundamentally the same. But he also talked about, and he said, but that's not as sexy as getting people to drive around in hydrogen cars. So it's not as politically correct. prioritized.

Speaker 1 | 37:39.690
And I would also wonder if the corporations and industries there have more lobbying power where they can go, it's going to cost so much money to change this, we don't want to do it, we're bringing in all this money, whereas people like you and I, we get attracted to cheaper fuel and we'll make that decision ourselves. Sure,

Speaker 0 | 37:56.433
yeah. But he said because of a variety of things, they've not been able to open as many hydrogen stations.

Speaker 1 | 38:05.855
You don't say.

Speaker 0 | 38:06.815
Well, the deal. Well, the original deal was to build like 250 stations in California, which actually would be a bunch. But they've only been able to get 65 open, which means that the people that they've convinced to buy hydrogen cars are having a harder time than they should be having. And so that's one of the biggest hurdles for consumer hydrogen. Kids got to take another quick break for Brooklinen. They are sponsoring today's podcast. It's getting to be a little bit hot. cozy season. You know what that means? Warm in bed time and it's a perfect time.

Moser. And they have tags that say short side, long side on the fitted sheet. Kline. They do! Moser. That is awesome. Kline.

Speaker 0 | 40:05.175
I forgot about that. It's stupid man tags. It helps you know who you're talking what side to put and what corner of the bed when you're making the bed.

Speaker 1 | 40:12.812
I didn't study rectangles in college. That helps me.

But he said, you know, like we've talked about with battery electric vehicles, you could have commercial vehicles that run the same route every day, easily converted to either battery or hydrogen. and you never have to worry about them being stranded at the Harris Ranch. We don't need to change Long Haul. Or consumers, we could do very, it could be mail trucks, it could be delivery trucks, or UPS, or Amazon, or anything that runs the same predictable route over and over.

Speaker 1 | 41:18.153
Yeah, I think a lot of airports are migrating towards electric vehicles, or tow vehicles and things, which makes sense, because of the torque. and the emissions, and it's a planned route. The challenge there is you have to remember to plug the thing in at a certain time, or if the temps vary, the range varies. But with hydrogen, you don't have that problem. You have the storage issue,

Speaker 0 | 41:36.442
of course. But if you had a big distribution center, you could have a tank of it on site that was filled once a week, and you could have a predictable filling schedule. You know, that was cool. The other thing I learned, because he was asking me about charging my Ford and how much it costs to charge it overnight at home and whatever, And I mentioned and maybe this is common knowledge that I just didn't know You know, I mentioned, you know, we usually charge it overnight off peak hours It's cheaper versus charging it during the day and he goes ah the coal charge. I go. What does that mean? He goes California has basically no capacity to store energy He said so, although we have a higher percentage of renewables than most during the day due to solar That energy does not sustain us through the night. Right,

Speaker 1 | 42:26.736
there's no way to capture it right now.

Speaker 0 | 42:27.897
Right, and so if you charge your car during off-peak at night, you are charging it with coal.

Speaker 1 | 42:33.920
Holy crap, Billy. Yeah. It's not a natural gas plant or something like that?

Speaker 0 | 42:36.942
He said most of it is coal. Oh, wow. Look, this wasn't a scientific symposium. This was two guys drinking bourbon in a backyard, but this guy is an expert in alternative energy, and this is the way he put it. And I'd love for him to come on the show and talk about it, and maybe he will. I think he's a very interesting guy. He's got 20 years experience in hydrogen. He's got a lot to say. But yeah, he basically was like, you're using emissions to charge your electric car by doing it at night. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 1 | 43:10.391
That's cool too. Because I know that energy capture is a big topic and they're like, the batteries have to be so gigantic. One company I read about was looking at using the solar to heat up. pellets in the daytime, so they're really hot, and then at night you could turn that into steam power, which is like.

Speaker 0 | 43:28.856
The barbecue method. But it's kind of,

Speaker 1 | 43:30.817
what an interesting way to solve that problem.

Speaker 0 | 43:32.238
Roasting a pig power.

Speaker 1 | 43:34.039
Yeah, kind of, it's like make coal that doesn't actually burn up. But when I read that I went, oh man, we're really.

Speaker 0 | 43:39.441
We're reaching.

Speaker 1 | 43:40.141
We're really having a hard time capturing this energy. Yeah.

Speaker 0 | 43:43.263
Yeah, and he said, he said the, you know, the energy use of our state, Excluding transportation during the darkness hours far surpasses what we can capture during the day with solar. He said it's just way beyond. He said that he, according to him, and granted this guy works in hydrogen, but he wasn't lobbying me. We were just talking about pragmatic, practical uses of alternative energy. He was like, the math is so fucked on making everybody switch to electric cars. It's just completely. There's no way. There's not even like, probably not. Probable ways to capture enough energy to make that solution work.

Speaker 1 | 44:30.833
Yeah I mean, the challenge, I think the thing is, any avenue forward that's different than now has big challenges. Like, hydrogen has infrastructure. You have to convert all the engines. And then, I mean, the Mirai does use some precious metals. Fewer than a battery, of course. But the big thing with hydrogen, and I know they're working on this. I'm not trying to say that that's not the right answer, hybrid is or EV is. But one of the things I read about hydrogen was that at the time, making hydrogen energy is dirty because it's made from natural gas, so you're still refining gas to get it. But they are working on technology, and I think Chile is doing a lot of this, which I learned when we did that show after Johnny Lieberman was here, on converting seawater to hydrogen. They found some really efficient ways to do that. Hills,

Speaker 0 | 45:22.561
Desalination.

Speaker 1 | 45:23.342
Desalination, and then you split the water out of it, and you do smart things I don't understand. And if they can power those plants. using renewable energy, then you have this wonderful like clean feedback loop. Yeah.

Speaker 0 | 45:35.237
And he, one of the biggest things that this guy was talking about was. One of the biggest hurdles for us as a state, which is the level he works at, state of California, or a country, is choosing one path and thinking that there's a one path solution. He's like, there's multiple paths that should be simultaneously pursued. You know, hydrogen for forklifts and local trucks and this and that and trains, you know, and maybe ships, and then battery electric for the. these other things and then hybrid for long range trucking and you know like he's like you could simultaneously pursue multiple paths. But, we've sort of latched on to electric because to the consumer, that really feels like the future. It's silent, it's techie, it's torquey and powerful and smooth. And people are, it's sort of the, where's my flying cars moment of like, when are we getting to the future?

Speaker 1 | 46:44.580
Well, I think it's also, we've talked about this after the Mirai situation, is that with electricity, electricity. electricity's everywhere. Because convincing the consumer to change from one propulsion to another is one thing, but I think if he's talking about changing the industry's mind, okay, well, you don't have to approach people like us to do that. But you still have to convince a human being or a group of them that hydrogen is the way, not the EV lobbyists that show up. And maybe it's just the problem with human nature is we see electricity as convenient because we interact with it every day, and it makes logical sense to the layperson.

Speaker 0 | 47:16.592
Well, if you have it coming to your house, you don't think about it not coming to your to your house anymore.

Speaker 1 | 47:21.154
Or to your ship port or something like that. But I guess the burden is, I mean, this is what this guy's job is, the burden is on them to explain the hydrogen system to the port of San Pedro or whoever, and try to convince them to go that direction instead of diesel or electricity.

Speaker 0 | 47:38.801
Yeah. So, anyway, it was very interesting. It turns out there's a totally explainable reason why this guy has five Toyota Mirais. He lends them out to people to do that. teach them about hydrogen. That's why he has them, so that makes sense. And he said he normally keeps them in his office, but his office is being renovated, and so he has to keep them. I was like, I know where a place where you can store cars, by the way, but he was like, yeah, my driveway's also free.

Speaker 1 | 48:06.712
Does he have a hydrogen tank in his backyard?

Speaker 0 | 48:08.933
Yeah,

Speaker 1 | 48:09.233
right. Is he a filling station for the area?

Speaker 0 | 48:11.274
No, but he is a real connoisseur of bourbon. Guy has a very impressive bourbon collection with some delightfully. rare stuff and it was it was nice to hang out I Think when he comes back from his travels that he should come on the show and yeah, that'd be great It was it was very very very interesting So, oh we got a couple more things then we can get to the question of the day did you see the story about Mr. Beast's experiment with the youtuber face. No like four people sent me this and And He basically said he did an experiment and that, there it is right there, IGN, that story. YouTube infamous shocked face thumbnails could be on the way out. Mr. Beast did an A-B test with the same exact center card of a video, only difference, one straight face, one YouTuber face, and he had higher numbers and better engagement. with a closed mouth, straight face.

Speaker 1 | 49:18.850
That's interesting. So the audience has gotten tired of open mouth, fake excitement face. And they're like, no, I want something more genuine. That's interesting.

Speaker 0 | 49:26.760
So a bunch of people sent me that, made me feel good. Shouldn't do the YouTuber face anymore. We could do the Throttle House tough guy face.

Speaker 1 | 49:35.211
Well, that's, I mean, Throttle House does it on YouTube, but that is also the Discovery Channel, every show that has men doing anything. It's arms crossed, looking tough.

Speaker 0 | 49:44.188
Shout out to blue collar TV.

Speaker 1 | 49:46.431
American Chopper probably started it. Shout out to those guys for innovating that.

Speaker 0 | 49:52.463
But I thought that was worth noting. Worth noting, yeah. So the YouTuber face might be on its way out.

Speaker 1 | 49:58.786
I can't fake smile for my life. Now I understand why Ken Block, one, wore sunglasses, and two, just opened his mouth. Because he looks excited like he's yelling, but he wasn't. And I'm like, that's great, because you can't force your eyes to, I can't force my eyes to fake smile. But I can just go like that.

Speaker 0 | 50:16.934
Right, so topic number seven. First impressions of the Polaris Slingshot. So haven't driven in the canyons yet. going to wait and see how that goes. But I've had 24 hours with this thing, and I have driven it all over. Yeah, the first thing we learned is that if you park it outside overnight in California, the condensation in the cabin in the morning will be a lot. It will look like you've just fucking fire-hosed it.

Speaker 1 | 50:45.289
I was going to say, it looked like your sprinklers kicked on.

Speaker 0 | 50:47.130
They did not. My sprinklers did not go on last night. That is pure condensation all over the thing. So good thing it's a water-resistant unit. So, there's a new engine, there's new steering, new brakes, new suspension. This one is a manual.

Speaker 1 | 51:04.799
Did they change the chassis?

Speaker 0 | 51:06.781
Don't think so. I don't think so. I'll have to look a little further into it. They gave me the, I haven't done the full thing yet. But pretty much all major componentry is new. And I gotta say, the guy wasn't wrong. it drives a lot better. The steering ratio is much faster, the clutch engagement is really good. It's actually very fast. I mean, I don't know about what the numbers would say, but the thing revs past eight, and when you get it over five, it goes like a motherfucker.

Speaker 1 | 51:45.325
Well, and you're making, what, Integra Type R?

Speaker 0 | 51:48.066
Yeah, it's like 208 horsepower and 1,600 pounds. Yeah. You're flying. All right. Yeah, it's quick. It's definitely quick. The brakes are, I don't actually believe that they are power assisted, but I don't, if they are, it's not much at all. But it's, so it's a firm pedal, but the brakes work really good. I was able to slide it very predictably and easily around some corners. It is really good for that. The quick steering, the steering ratio is much better. The engine's definitely not as refined as like a Honda four cylinder. especially at the low power bands, it feels more like something you'd get from, I don't know, Nissan maybe. But still, it's got the revs and it's got the power, and it would be really easy to teach someone to drive stick on this. You can pull away from a stop without using the accelerator at all. And like, dynamically, it's a lot better. It actually is responsive and fast. and sporty. So first impressions, you know, it's, my wife is very ashamed to have this thing parked in our driveway.

Speaker 1 | 53:07.156
It looks like a sneaker. It looks, the color's great. If you're listening, like the color's this cool teal, pearlescent blue, which looks rad, but it is that color with lots of orange accents. I mean, it looks like a sprinter's shoe.

Speaker 0 | 53:19.861
It's pretty aggressive. And it's also like, it doesn't really feel like you're driving a real car. It feels like you're driving. driving like a toy. Like, it's a lot of plastic, and it does have, like, a real stereo with Bluetooth and even car play, wired car play. It has heated and cooled seats. The cooled seats particularly come in handy if you leave this thing out in the sun. The black seat gets really hot. But like, it does still feel like a toy.

Speaker 1 | 53:52.554
But... But it's a fun toy.

Speaker 0 | 53:54.475
At least, like... Like when I first drove this thing, I was like, you know, driving a three-wheeled vehicle is dangerous. It just is. But originally I said that the dynamics of the vehicle were not worth the trade-off in safety. I'm not saying you couldn't get better dynamics from something else, especially for $34,000, you probably could. But the things that they have done have improved it substantially, and at least in the way that I have driven it so far, it is responsive, it is quick, it does the things that you would expect a sports car to do. and the fact that it has quick steering and not much grip at the rear means that if you wanted to slide something around a little bit at lower speeds, I wouldn't fucking huck it into a slide at 80. It's like a GR86. It kind of, a little bit.

Speaker 1 | 54:52.554
Can you feel that there's only one tire in the back and that's in the center? Oh yeah. Because it doesn't lean as much that way,

Speaker 0 | 54:59.237
right? Actually, you know what it's good for? If you pull into the driveways, like, you know, driveways in California, because the roads are crowned, it's sort of, they're sort of steep and funky angles, and it's actually better than a regular car. You don't catch that curb on the outside, on the inside rear tire, the way you do. So you can actually pull into driveways like kinda hot.

Speaker 1 | 55:22.435
When you go around a corner fast, I know you haven't been to the canyons yet, but maybe, does the rear wheel, does the suspension compress at all, like mid-corner? Because you know that it's- Well, I mean, I'm just thinking about the physics, like, you know, if it's gonna lean left.

Speaker 0 | 55:36.611
Yeah.

Speaker 1 | 55:37.432
Well, there's no, you'd need two wheels for that, I think, right? So it almost seems like the center wheel would stay static and then you lean on the front.

Speaker 0 | 55:43.034
I think the center wheels would stay flat. I think that that center can articulate a bit from an angle, I think, I am not sure.

Speaker 1 | 55:51.658
Or it's the higher flexion. That's just something that popped in my head that's interesting. Yeah. But it's cool. I mean, the thing is silly and it looks like a transformer, but if it's going to be, if the first one purported to be a quick and exciting and novelty thing. but then drove like shit. Well then you're not getting what you paid for really. Now you get all the extroverted stuff it has.

Speaker 0 | 56:11.511
The first one legit drove like you put street tires on a UTV. Like it didn't drive well. It had like straight up like UTV steering. Like it wasn't good. This is like someone who knows sports cars has gone through this and be like, no, no, there's a way that a sports car should drive and so we do these things. Gotcha. So yeah, no, like you're gonna have it, you'll have it for a couple days before we make the film. So you can enjoy it. You have a helmet. Yep. Yeah. You should definitely wear a helmet.

Speaker 1 | 56:38.257
Oh, I'm gonna. Yeah. This would be a riot on an autocross course. Probably. That'd be a fun way to test it. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 56:42.658
probably. It would be a good time. And it scoots. It's not bad. I'm kind of impressed at what they've been able to do based on where it was six or seven years ago. It's not like I don't feel cool when I drive it. Some people do, but I don't really feel cool. But like, dynamically, so far, nice job. Yeah, it's alright. So it's, I forget the guy's name who told me to drive it from Polaris, the racing engineer. Josh or John, something with a J. James maybe. But he was right.

Speaker 1 | 57:22.935
That's pretty good.

Speaker 0 | 57:24.735
Okay, question OTD. We have the question OTD, which is from last show, which is, who said that question? Did we copy their name? I don't know.

Speaker 1 | 57:35.480
Bad Gardner.

Speaker 0 | 57:36.460
There you go. Thank you, Bad Gardner. He said, what are some cars that look light but are actually heavy, and what are some cars that look like they'd be heavy but are actually light?

Speaker 1 | 57:46.124
And his example was he was shocked to learn the Countach is about 300 pounds lighter than a Testarossa. Yeah. And the Testarossa is not a light car.

Speaker 0 | 57:55.268
Testarossas are heavy. Yeah.

Speaker 1 | 57:56.608
They're like 3,600 pounds. It was like 3,600, 3,700 pounds, which is wild. And so...

Speaker 0 | 58:02.310
Flat 12, that's a heavy engine.

Speaker 1 | 58:04.231
Right, because the comparison... I found was a brand-new Camaro SS, which is over a foot longer. The displacement is much greater than a Testarossa. It weighs 3,700 pounds. It's like the same. But I did read that the Testarossa, the European cars were like 300 pounds lighter, because they didn't have door crash bars, cats, smog shit, a bunch of other things. So those were a little bit more close to like a sports car.

Speaker 0 | 58:29.541
Hilliard But also, you know, Testarossa, like the Countach, really good comparison for the Countach, because that's the original. the Kuntosh later, but the Tessaros also has six shock absorbers. It's got four in the rear. Yeah, that's a four coilover shock absorbers. So that probably adds, you know, 40 or 45 pounds by itself.

Speaker 1 | 58:47.514
Probably. And the Kuntosh got heavier through the years too. Yours, the 5000, is like the heaviest one. Well,

Speaker 0 | 58:52.658
it had four valve heads.

Speaker 1 | 58:53.278
It was like 33, yeah.

Speaker 0 | 58:54.499
Yeah, and wider wheels. The Anniversary is even heavier.

Speaker 1 | 58:57.938
He's got a lot of ugly shit on him.

Speaker 0 | 58:59.058
He's got a lot of ugly shit on him. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1 | 59:02.598
My age is so bad.

Speaker 0 | 59:03.279
Well, I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven cars that are either lighter or heavier than you might expect them to be.

Speaker 1 | 59:11.260
I have seven as well. Okay.

Speaker 0 | 59:13.741
Because I don't need a concussion. You go first.

Speaker 1 | 59:15.501
All right. Let's see. So my first list is cars that were surprisingly heavy. This one's a new car. Bronco Raptor. 5,700 pounds. Oh, that's heavy. Which, I'm not sure, is a lot of weight. considering it has very little sound deadening, and people don't,

Speaker 0 | 59:31.886
people like- The wheels and tires,

Speaker 1 | 59:33.628
dude. Wheels and tires.

Speaker 0 | 59:34.428
Wheels and tires are so heavy.

Speaker 1 | 59:35.669
People bitch all the time about how heavy EVs are. That is the same as a Lucid or anything else. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 59:41.754
but if you're building something, you gotta, it's gotta really take abuse. I know. That comes from weight.

Speaker 1 | 59:47.378
I agree, and that truck thing is awesome, but I went, whoa, that's the same as like Lotus Elettrae, and everyone's like, look at these heavy EVs. They're gonna kill all the pedestrians. Like. Bronco Raptor, same weight. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 59:59.965
yeah, okay. Cars that are surprisingly heavy, I'll go with a pair of... Ferraris hmm the 296 which is a hybrid That's 3,700 pounds. It's a lot heavier than you might expect a mid-engine Ferrari to be how about the 2005 Ferrari 612 Scalietti 4060 pounds whoa yeah, that one's in the force Yeah, now granted 12 cylinders four seats, but still but it's a 4,000 pound 2005 Ferrari well on a related note Ferrari FF

Speaker 1 | 60:33.518
4,150 pounds.

Speaker 0 | 60:36.540
Also V12. At all-wheel drive.

Speaker 1 | 60:37.340
At all-wheel drive. And what I thought was interesting is that 911 Turbo weighs almost 400 pounds less. Yeah. Also has all-wheel drive transaxle.

Speaker 0 | 60:46.467
Half the cylinders.

Speaker 1 | 60:47.188
Half the cylinders. Saved 350 pounds.

Speaker 0 | 60:49.930
Okay, another car that's heavier than you think. What else you got?

Speaker 1 | 60:56.958
I don't know if this is heavier than one might think, but man, it's a lot. 2023, challenge your Hellcat.

Speaker 0 | 61:05.582
Oh, yeah.

Speaker 1 | 61:06.322
So that's 4,400 pounds. Is it really?

Speaker 0 | 61:08.962
The Challenger, not even the Charger.

Speaker 1 | 61:10.863
And the car it competes directly with, Camaro SS ZL1, is 500 pounds lighter than that.

Speaker 0 | 61:19.465
Nice.

Speaker 1 | 61:19.906
500 pounds, same number of seats, like basically competitors.

Speaker 0 | 61:23.867
4,400 is a ton for a two-door car. Even with 700 horsepower.

Speaker 1 | 61:28.008
Yeah, for a two-door car, that's not a Rolls Royce. Yeah.

Speaker 0 | 61:31.769
Here's another one, the new AMG GT. Brand new. Oh. Which is basically now the SL with a hard top. Mm-hmm. 43-43. Wah, wah. For the AMG GT?

Speaker 1 | 61:45.151
When was the last one way?

Speaker 0 | 61:46.994
It was in the threes. Yeah,

Speaker 1 | 61:50.306
it's up a lot.

Speaker 0 | 61:52.146
They've added a back seat, they've added all-wheel drive.

Speaker 1 | 61:55.847
The last gen, the 2021 GTC weighed 3,800 pounds.

Speaker 0 | 62:01.548
So it's packed on 500 pounds in a generation.

Speaker 1 | 62:05.169
That's not good. That's not what that car needed, because that was a great-sized car.

Speaker 0 | 62:09.950
Not great. Okay, you got another heavy? I have one more heavy.

Speaker 1 | 62:13.930
I don't have another heavy. Okay,

Speaker 0 | 62:15.171
my final heavy, here's a good one for you. 1998 Mercedes Mercedes, sorry, not Mercedes Mitsubishi 3000 GT VR for spider.

Speaker 1 | 62:28.695
Oh boy, right 4123 pounds two-door car 1998 two-door all-wheel drive will drive twin turbo Retractable hardtop and probably a hydraulic retractable power back then our right but not not electronic sir I don't know.

Speaker 0 | 62:46.662
I think fucking knows.

Speaker 1 | 62:47.563
Let me if it's hydro. I think it's heavier than if it today. That's a lot.

Speaker 0 | 62:49.904
It's heavy as shit. 4123 in 1998.

Speaker 1 | 62:54.486
That's like peak complexity, but before we got carbon and aluminum and everything. That's the perfect wrong formula.

Speaker 0 | 63:01.548
Yeah, yeah. That's a real hold my beer car.

Speaker 1 | 63:03.509
A convertible.

Speaker 0 | 63:05.290
Yeah. All right, how about some surprisingly light?

Speaker 1 | 63:09.612
Well, first Countach, 2,800 pounds. Wow, yeah. LP400. That's very light.

Speaker 0 | 63:14.013
That's very light. Very light. 2,800. Right? Skinny wheels. Little motor, low roof,

Speaker 1 | 63:21.877
yeah. And yours is like 3,300.

Speaker 0 | 63:24.858
Sure, mine has more shit.

Speaker 1 | 63:26.038
But yeah,

Speaker 0 | 63:26.658
it's like a C6 Camaro. We saw that spacer they put in the fucking motor. That's probably 30 pounds.

Speaker 1 | 63:30.640
That's definitely probably 30 pounds.

Speaker 0 | 63:32.621
Okay, how about the current generation Honda Civic? 3,050 pounds. Not the Type R, for the regular Civic Sport or whatever.

Speaker 1 | 63:42.465
So you have that too? No, I have something very related. 2022 Honda Insight, same size as the Civic. It's a hybrid, got a battery, 3,000 to 3,100 pounds. It's the same. Whatever Honda's doing, like their cars are big, and yet way very little.

Speaker 0 | 63:59.532
A Honda door slam, you can feel that, there's not much going on in there.

Speaker 1 | 64:02.693
It feels precise but light, yeah. Right,

Speaker 0 | 64:04.314
yeah, well made, but not dense.

Speaker 1 | 64:06.634
It's like a canvas airplane. Right.

Speaker 0 | 64:09.376
Oh, speaking of which, yeah, someone, I asked some people on Twitter to help me solve this one, and someone, I retweeted it, if you want to go to the Twitter, someone came up with a... formula to calculate vehicle density and found the densest vehicles which was totally unsurprising. The list of densest vehicles which is incredibly predictable. How about for light cars? The Nissan Kicks. Do you know what a Nissan Kicks is? It's what the uh, fuckin' what's the thing with the frog face?

Speaker 1 | 64:47.411
The XB? No.

Speaker 0 | 64:48.412
No, no, the, the... Jesus Christ. Which frog face? The thing they turned into the... The thing with the head of the frog? Piranha? No, the other, the little one.

Speaker 1 | 64:56.356
Oh, the...

Speaker 0 | 64:59.217
The thing they made a jeep, the juke. The juke became the kicks. Oh, okay. So the Nissan... kicks is 2,700 pounds.

Speaker 1 | 65:06.356
Damn. Yeah.

Speaker 0 | 65:07.539
What? Yeah. 2700 for this thing yeah,

Speaker 1 | 65:10.779
how about that that's incredible for a little crossover like a modern crossover Yeah, I want to show a picture because it deserves it Wow 2700 pounds pretty light dear Lotus. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 65:22.826
you have competition What else you have for light anything? What else you got for light?

Speaker 1 | 65:28.229
And take her type s is impressive for a new car, but I think La Ferrari You weighed V12 hybrid, and it weighs 3,500 pounds. Hilliard Oh, that's good. Moser Which is impressive for that.

Speaker 0 | 65:43.007
Hilliard Yeah, carbon tub, carbon body, carbon seats.

Speaker 1 | 65:46.388
Moser Now, what do you think the 918 fell?

Speaker 0 | 65:49.188
Hilliard I bet it's 300 pounds heavier. 38 and change.

Speaker 1 | 65:55.950
Moser You are correct. Why do you think that? Hilliard Just because. Moser Its battery is about three times the size. Hilliard Oh, okay. Moser Yeah, it's a 6.8. kilowatt hours and the LaFerrari battery is tiny 2.3.

Speaker 0 | 66:08.874
Yeah so that makes sense. I'll track that. How about this one is this one is it's not that it's light it's kind of light. The current Cayenne turbo is 5,050 pounds, which is a lot. But it is, in the last 20 years they've been building that car, been building a Cayenne Turbo for 20 years now, the current car is 100 pounds lighter than the 2004 Cayenne Turbo. See,

Speaker 1 | 66:43.509
other OEMs, that's doing it right. Yeah. Using material science, that's great.

Speaker 0 | 66:46.730
There's a reason, it's because the original car had a bunch of off-roady shit in it that they took out. Nobody's going off-roading in a Cayenne Turbo. using the original Cayenne turbos for these overlanding builds.

Speaker 1 | 66:58.393
Because they're overbuilt?

Speaker 0 | 66:59.393
Yeah. People were not going off-roading in Cayenne turbos, so they were like, no, people want to go fast in the street in these, so that's what it's got. But still, I'll count it for this game.

Speaker 1 | 67:09.397
That's pretty good.

Speaker 0 | 67:10.117
Now, the density chart is Chihos on Twitter. Shout out to him. I queried a database of 53,000 vehicles by dimension and built a density value. The mass of a car divided by dimensions of the third car. 30 most dense cars. There are nine Mercedes SLs, 14 Bentleys, some G-Wagons, an H1, the Subaru SVX, and the Jag XJS.

Speaker 1 | 67:39.573
The Subaru SVX is there.

Speaker 0 | 67:42.154
The Continental GT has essentially the same rectangular volume as a Chevy HHR, with 59% more kilograms to haul. Note this method will overstate the density on less boxy cars. So that's pretty. Pretty interesting, isn't it?

Speaker 1 | 68:02.090
Kilograms per square meter. Right? Cool. Wow, the Conti GT zone. Yeah.

Speaker 0 | 68:08.191
That's great. I mean, it's not at all, you know, when we drive a Continental GT or a Mercedes SL or a G-Wagon, you can feel that. Of course. You can absolutely feel the density and it's the opposite of what you feel in a modern Honda. Right. I mean, it's just, it's different strokes for different folks, right? But like, it's a shout out to Chihho.

Speaker 1 | 68:31.696
This is the density cost to be the boss.

Speaker 0 | 68:34.498
Oh, here we go. That's a good one. Scroll down. Since 2000, other very dense cars consist of a ton of VW, Audi, Phaeton, Chiron. On the light side, excluding vans and trucks, the Mark VII Golf reigns supreme. The 4C is very undense. Is undense, is that a word? What's the opposite of dense? As are the mid-engine V8 Ferraris, a Huracan is 24% more dense than an F8. How interesting. Shout out to Chihos on Twitter for that math. I love I love when the internet brings you gold like that Thin is the opposite dense.

Speaker 1 | 69:13.983
Okay I had two more. Okay, what are your older cars? They're surprisingly light. Okay 1963 beetle hardtop.

Speaker 0 | 69:23.545
Oh,

Speaker 1 | 69:24.085
yeah 1600 pounds. I mean it feels like it. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 69:28.926
but holy shit. Nothing to it.

Speaker 1 | 69:30.566
Yeah, but then this one I thought was really surprising. What do you think in? 1965 Ford 1900 style-side ways.

Speaker 0 | 69:40.589
3100.

Speaker 1 | 69:42.350
It's 3,225. And an F-250 back then was only 3,500. That's like Corvette weight. Whereas today, the lightest F-250 I could find, I looked quickly, is 5,700 pounds, and that's not even Super Duty territory.

Speaker 0 | 69:58.397
That's crazy. That's a good game.

Speaker 1 | 70:00.838
I like that game.

Speaker 0 | 70:01.719
Shout-out to Bad Gardener for that. for that very high quality game. Let's see, we probably have some Patreon questions. We can do some of these. Oh my God, really? We have that many?

Speaker 1 | 70:11.595
We have a excited audience.

Speaker 0 | 70:13.776
There is fucking no chance we're gonna get through all these today, but we will do the best we can and we can kind of eliminate, well, we don't have to eliminate ones that we've talked about. We'll see what we get. Of course, if you wanna talk to us through the program, patreon.com slash the Smoking Tire Podcast. Oh, speaking of which, schedule. Rescheduling update, the RU Garbage crossover show will not be on Monday the 25th, it will be on Sunday the 24th at noon Pacific. Kevin Ryan hit me up this morning and had to reschedule. And if you are in LA and you're going to the RU Garbage show on the 22nd, which is Friday, yes, Friday, Zach and I will see you there. We will be going. All right. Some people asking. cars and lightnesses. Let's see, I don't know. Okay, wow, there's a lot of fucking... Alright, a lot of weights. Did you ask this before in the weights? No,

Speaker 1 | 71:18.858
I said we're talking about it. I said here's what we're talking about today, and then ask questions.

Speaker 0 | 71:22.599
Alright, Alejandro said, I've seen the Mercedes GLE bouncing mode video going around recently. Any other cars with unusual gimmicks like that? The only other cars... Other cars that come to mind is the concept Bose suspension that could jump over speed bumps.

Speaker 1 | 71:37.865
That was the early 90s, I think they did that?

Speaker 0 | 71:40.066
Who was I just, yeah, I was just talking to Matej Ramac, Ramac at the Quail. They will have, I don't know if it's going to make it into a production car, but they have some prototypes of technologies that can jump over potholes. What? Yeah. Wow. Yeah. It scans the road ahead and can pick wheels up off the ground. Yeah. It doesn't jump, but it can unload one wheel to smooth out.

Speaker 1 | 72:08.518
So basically it can retract the shock.

Speaker 0 | 72:10.358
Yes, kind of, yeah. There's not a lot of other cars that have had, other than Citroen. Citroen has had the original hydraulic suspension that could pick up a wheel to change a tire or do any kinds of cool shit like that. And there's stuff, there's weird shit from the 30s and 40s. Remember that video where it would lower that wheel and back the fifth wheel?

Speaker 1 | 72:32.467
To help you parallel.

Speaker 0 | 72:34.708
Yeah, that's always going on.

Speaker 1 | 72:35.828
That video's really funny.

Speaker 0 | 72:37.109
Yeah, but that hydraulic suspension that's in the GLE and the Maybach is very cool, but like real expensive. It's not particularly practical for a lot of things. Alan says AE86 versus E30, oh wait, AE86 GTS, meaning that's the old car. Yeah,

Speaker 1 | 72:58.658
old car.

Speaker 0 | 72:59.238
Versus E30 325, which do you prefer? 325.

Speaker 1 | 73:02.259
325. 325.

Speaker 0 | 73:03.340
I'd probably prefer the E30, although the 86s are very fun. I just prefer the look of the E30, I think. Chris N. says, Zach, what would you buy for $150,000, new or used?

Speaker 1 | 73:15.264
550 Maranello with a manual.

Speaker 0 | 73:18.886
Good choice. Tim says, Zach, how is your M3 as a camping vehicle?

Speaker 1 | 73:25.949
Bad, as soon as the road gets anything other than paved.

Speaker 0 | 73:29.770
How would it be different than any other coupe as a camping vehicle? You just put stuff. in it and then take it out when you go camping?

Speaker 1 | 73:35.793
I took it camping once and I couldn't go up a road that had rocks on it that were larger than three of these coasters, so I camped where I was. But yeah, off-grid? Not that one. I would not choose the M3 for off-grid camping.

Speaker 0 | 73:50.058
Tim A. says, or not Tim A., sorry, Bobby says, I'm doing a thing where I buy a watch, keep it for a few months, and then sell it and buy it for something $1,000 more than the previous watch sells for. That sounds like a fun game. My next watch when I sell my Omega Speedmaster Racing should be $4,000 to $5,000. What would you look at? Tudor Black Bay or Tudor Pelagos, both of those would be very nice. Omega Planet Ocean would be very nice. A Bell and Ross or a used Panerai Radiomir would be pretty cool. That's kind of where I would look. Or maybe a Breitling Super Ocean, preferably Super Ocean 42 with Arabic numerals. That could be cool. That's kind of where I'd be. Flannel Bob says, oh, that's more... Power to weight stuff. Randy says the 2024 Toyota Century SUV seems like a perfect vehicle for America. What are our chances of seeing it make its way here? If so, only as a Lexus. You know Americans do not, we don't understand an expensive Toyota. True. But I could, I mean, I could see it. I mean, it's got Cullen and Vibes, obviously. I don't know what they would do with the front end to turn it into a Lexus, but I think it would make a good Lexus, right?

Speaker 1 | 75:14.310
I agree. I mean, this is... This would be my favorite of the Lexus aesthetics of recent years. I think the Lexus is just not for me right now. But they do seem to be leaning even harder into the angular design at Lexus and Toyota, but this thing looks sweet. Profile's great.

Speaker 0 | 75:30.948
Yeah, it's cool. I'm definitely into it. But apparently it's front wheel drive based architecture, which is no bueno. But.

Speaker 1 | 75:40.530
That's a hard, that would be a hard sell here too.

Speaker 0 | 75:42.311
That would be a tough sell here. Let's see. Oh Surprise sound guy says wanted us to throw one in the surprisingly light which is the DeLorean is 2,700 pounds despite rumors of being heavy Yeah, I mean that that actually tracks. I'm not I think people assume. They're heavy because they're slow Yeah,

Speaker 1 | 76:04.939
lean a lot and yeah,

Speaker 0 | 76:06.459
I mean they're they're not well engineered,

Speaker 1 | 76:08.460
but they're like heavy Well the I mean the doors were heavy I remember opening the doors was a steering heavy like it's a power steering so the things you interact with I think are The controls are heavy.

Speaker 0 | 76:20.525
I've talked about this in other videos, I forget specifically where, but I don't like when people take out power steering or power brakes because the car is light, but it ends up making the car feel really heavy. I don't wanna drive a light car that feels heavy. And taking out power steering and taking out power brakes is a really good way to do that. And yeah, DeLorean has no power assists and all the controls are heavy. and clunky.

Speaker 1 | 76:47.896
And it's slow and it leans a lot. It has all the attributes of a slow, heavy sedan.

Speaker 0 | 76:54.819
Driving Cook says, I have a 2020 Mustang Performance Pack 2 and should I trade in my Mustang for a Civic Type R, assuming I can get one close to sticker? I have a 2014 Focus ST as my daily and I live in Atlanta. I wouldn't want a Focus ST as a daily and a Civic Type R as a weekend car.

Speaker 1 | 77:17.288
They're too similar.

Speaker 0 | 77:17.948
Too similar. Yep. It's just a slightly faster version of what you've got. I think having a front-wheel drive, sporty daily, and then some kind of more dedicated sports car for a weekend. If you're over the Mustang, you know, maybe you want a really nice S2000. Maybe you want to try and get into an NSX. Maybe you want to try a Corvette or a Viper.

Speaker 1 | 77:42.018
Yeah, I would take a step up. Or a Porsche. And change the layout in some way. That would be exciting too.

Speaker 0 | 77:47.080
Yeah. uh... matches will be in says uh... that uh... saw on the wccs i g that we have a type thirty five who got it south bay is there a limit on the value of a car you'll store uh... there is not a limit of the value of car will store and that we got a type thirty five is a per se and it's not an original which is fine means it's like half a million dollars instead of ten million dollars uh... if the cars we store are over a million there is an insurance surcharge i don't make a profit on that but when If your car is so expensive that my insurance goes up, I pass that on to you. And so there are a few people here that are paying what I call the pay the cost to be the boss tax. And if your car is worth over a million bucks, I don't want to hear your fucking bitching about the insurance. Sean Stewart says, where in the US have you encountered the worst group of drivers?

Speaker 1 | 78:43.965
There's some pretty bad ones here.

Speaker 0 | 78:45.426
And worst is not a, worst is not specific enough. Like New York has the most aggressive drivers.

Speaker 1 | 78:52.028
Yeah, but I trust them.

Speaker 0 | 78:54.069
Right, LA has the most aloof drivers. They're not paying attention, they're on their phone.

Speaker 1 | 78:59.670
And I would say they're very selfish. People drive as if, with them running red lights, that's what matters, they gotta get somewhere. There's a lot of that shit. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 79:07.391
yeah, that's true. Self-importance is really, is higher here than it is in New York.

Speaker 1 | 79:11.492
It's the narcissistic nationals.

Speaker 0 | 79:12.833
Yeah, in New York it's like, it's frustration with the infrastructure and the traffic. and just a bunch of fucking tightly wound people.

Speaker 1 | 79:19.801
Well, I've never ridden with cab drivers. New York is amazing because the cab drivers will be very calm. Yeah. And they don't yell or anything, but they make moves like anyone else would be swearing and putting the flashing lights on the roof. Like those, they just go for gaps. Yeah.

Speaker 0 | 79:35.994
but I've seen some like in Florida, horrible. Florida is the most, yeah, LA you have a loof and you have self-important. Florida you have just don't give a fuck about anybody else at all. It's not even self-importance, it's just like living in a place where you just don't care about anything. You're fine. I've never been somewhere outside of, especially Miami, where I think people are most likely to double park for extended periods of time, not giving a shit what kind of traffic that's causing. And it's always fucking bad. Yeah, yeah. You know where there's good drivers, I think? Like the Pacific Northwest. Seattle and Portland, I think, because they get a lot of weather to deal with, they take pretty good care of their cars, you know, they're good at driving in bad weather. Same as Colorado, pretty good. Places where you have to deal with bad weather pretty regularly, people seem to be a little more attentive.

Speaker 1 | 80:46.130
Yeah, and they're more relaxed, I think. Yeah. Outdoorsy folks.

Speaker 0 | 80:48.671
Yeah. as another manual transmission option has ended, Volkswagen Golf, actually two, the Mini, the new Mini will not have a manual. How will you change your description of auto transmissions in the future? Will you ever stop mentioning a no manual option in your reviews? I mean, I think you get one generation of that.

Speaker 1 | 81:15.861
Right, I think we keep mentioning it if competitors also offer manuals. Right. And then once that fades away and the audience. doesn't even know what a manual is or doesn't expect there to be an option, then it just goes away.

Speaker 0 | 81:31.147
Hills. 404 user not found. I rebadged my Fusion to be Fission a while ago. What is the most creative rebadge of a car you've ever seen? Oh, I saw one that was like... Oh shit, what was it? It was RAM. War?

Speaker 1 | 81:50.706
Where they flip it.

Speaker 0 | 81:51.567
Yeah, it might have been War.

Speaker 1 | 81:53.147
I've seen that with War Wagon.

Speaker 0 | 81:54.387
Yeah,

Speaker 1 | 81:55.147
War Wagon. It's pretty good, I gotta say. Like I don't wanna hang out with that person maybe. No, for sure. Or if they're a huge Mad Max fan, then I do. But I do think that's creative and it uses the original letters.

Speaker 0 | 82:05.309
Right.

Speaker 1 | 82:06.090
I remember in 09 I saw a Bentley Continental GT that had changed the badge out for a Hyundai badge. That's pretty funny. Because it fit perfectly and they're just trolling the world.

Speaker 0 | 82:16.192
I saw someone that rebadged their Civic Si as the Civic Hybrid. They put the hybrid wheels on it. They made the whole car look like a hybrid, but it was an Si. It was a whole car cosmetics. I thought that was pretty cool.

Speaker 1 | 82:29.561
That's pretty good.

Speaker 0 | 82:30.222
Yeah. Let's see. Nothing else that really comes to mind. I mean, Deadmau5 and his Pirari, that was pretty fun. That's pretty good. Fishing,

Speaker 1 | 82:46.708
fishing. Yeah. I don't know,

Speaker 0 | 82:47.388
I'll take photos of it. Joe Curran, two questions. Would you consider owning a sailboat? Fuck yeah! And if so, what would it be? Are there any yacht timers or sailing watches that you've owned or want to own? I love a regatta timer, which has the countdown. It's a chronograph, but it counts down from 15 or 10 minutes to zero. to help you time the start of the watch. I love the Hoyer Carrera Skipper, but it's too small for me. I would buy a sailboat. I don't really know exactly what I would like. Swan makes some amazing boats that are beautiful and comfortable and well made and fast. And if I was fucking just balling out of control somehow, I'd want a Wally. They're fucking crazy. Let's see, Sunny says, oh, what did you find?

Speaker 1 | 83:39.865
Sunny says,

Speaker 0 | 83:40.245
I want to buy a 987 Cayman Boxster. Does 30,000 vs. 60,000 miles really matter at this age? I feel like I have to replace some stuff either way due to age. Does it really matter?

Speaker 1 | 83:57.732
I think it depends on how long you're going to keep it and drive it. I think if you drive a car, if you buy it with 30,000 miles and you drive it to... at $450,000, it's probably not going to lose a ton of money. But if you put 20,000 miles on a 60 car, once you start getting near 100, I think then you start losing more and more value more quickly.

Speaker 0 | 84:18.641
Yeah, I'd say the current condition and service history of the car matter more than the mileage number at this age.

Speaker 1 | 84:28.625
I think the condition you'll get the car in, yes. I think the resale eventually, which I know is hard to plan for. Buying the car with the lower miles is probably smarter, even though there's... They're both in that meat of who cares if you're going to keep it for three years driving it 8,000 miles a year. You'll be knocking on the door of 90,000 miles with the other one.

Speaker 0 | 84:44.511
Yeah. Yeah. Speedy P, did we see that Colin McRae's personal 22B sold at auction for nearly 500,000 pounds. That to me seems low.

Speaker 1 | 84:56.836
That seems like a steal.

Speaker 0 | 84:57.676
That seems low.

Speaker 1 | 84:58.317
Because aren't these selling for 300 anyway?

Speaker 0 | 85:00.578
A regular good one is like 300. I think whoever bought this got a great price.

Speaker 1 | 85:06.002
I'm really surprised.

Speaker 0 | 85:07.242
I mean, that's a lot of money, don't get me wrong, but if that's a documented Colin McRae car that's the road-going version of the car he raced, and it's only got 8,000 miles on it, that's a fucking steal. Ton of money.

Speaker 1 | 85:21.846
It was a prototype. Oh,

Speaker 0 | 85:22.746
it's a pre-production chassis zero? Dude, stole it. Stole it. I mean, what are the chances that that doesn't become a million dollar car? I mean, honestly. Yeah. That's crazy. I think it's a great deal.

Speaker 1 | 85:39.234
Yeah, I agree.

Speaker 0 | 85:40.034
Yeah, if I had the money and I was there, I would have paid more.

Speaker 1 | 85:44.235
I'm pretty sure those are selling for like 325 if it's a normal one.

Speaker 0 | 85:49.876
Jack Volger says, in honor of the GTI losing the manual, what has been your favorite manual Volkswagen over the years?

Speaker 1 | 86:02.919
2004 R32. Bye! I think like Mark IV GTI. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 86:14.935
Mark IV, right? That's like a 04, 05? Yeah. Yeah, I like the R32 of that year.

Speaker 1 | 86:19.175
Because the R32, I mean, I don't know. I can't remember how the shifting feel changed between them. I just remember them being pretty solid for a long time. Yeah. Somewhere between BMW and Honda. Yeah. For reference, a few months ago, a 22B sold. It had 115,000 miles on the clock, and that sold for 250 grand.

Speaker 0 | 86:38.399
Holy fuck, really? Yeah. The 115,000 miles per clock? Yeah. Wow. Well sold.

Speaker 1 | 86:43.621
That's wild.

Speaker 0 | 86:44.962
Yeah. So a 2X premium for McRae, not ignoring that it's a prototype, ignoring that it's only got 8,000 miles on it.

Speaker 1 | 86:53.645
That's insane.

Speaker 0 | 86:54.325
That's a great deal. Yeah. Ton of money, but a great deal. Okay, wait. Let me see if I can understand this. RD Speed Garage says, what's your flavor? What would you take in this scenario? More identical super cars. but the powertrain on each one is different. NA, turbo, EV, or hybrid? NA.

Speaker 1 | 87:17.315
Oh, yeah,

Speaker 0 | 87:18.155
definitely. Yeah, pick your powertrain. Yeah. Yeah, NA. It's not hard. That's an easy one.

Speaker 1 | 87:23.097
Especially if the horsepower is all close. Yeah,

Speaker 0 | 87:24.678
if it's the same power, same car, NA. Yeah. Absolutely. Manual transmission, NA. Just look at what I own. Every one of my cars is mid-engine, stick shift, not all mid-engine. We have a front engine V12, then we have a mid-engine V12. Mid-engine v8 mid-engine v6 Engine mid-engine flat six cow front all manual engine. Yeah, but that's Hannah's.

Speaker 1 | 87:46.346
Oh,

Speaker 0 | 87:47.026
yeah Hannah's and the van is fucking mid-engine if we want to play that Yeah, mid engine Fucking stick shift naturally aspirated. It's all I need. No problem That's the game folks Thank you very much for playing What do we have on the calendar Zach and I are gonna go drive the Polaris slingshot next week

Speaker 1 | 88:09.516
And then we also have, what, Bentley Continental?

Speaker 0 | 88:12.657
No, we got a Flying Spur. Flying Spur Speed, kind of the opposite end of the spectrum there. I'm going to go to Colorado to drive the E-Ray for Road Track, which I don't know when the embargo is on that. And then...

Speaker 1 | 88:26.462
I go to Italy to drive Porsche 911 ST.

Speaker 0 | 88:29.043
That's the next week. Yep.

Speaker 1 | 88:31.144
Right?

Speaker 0 | 88:31.604
That's when I'm going to Performance Car of the Year at Thunder Hill.

Speaker 1 | 88:36.046
No, you go to Nismo. Oh, yeah. Picos after that.

Speaker 0 | 88:39.347
Yeah. Yeah, that's when I said I would drive a Nissan Z instead of going to Italy to drive a Baccarat.

Speaker 1 | 88:43.569
I was surprised that you preferred the Nissan to the 911, but you do. Yeah. You did.

Speaker 0 | 88:48.331
I do prefer a 90-minute flight.

Speaker 1 | 88:51.292
See? I'm traveling like 30 hours. I know. It's a small place in Italy, so it's three flights.

Speaker 0 | 88:56.054
I know. It's three? Yeah. Where do you have to go through?

Speaker 1 | 88:59.035
I think Frankfurt and then maybe Rome and then to another place.

Speaker 0 | 89:02.737
Is it a charter? I don't know. Is it Frankfurt to?

Speaker 1 | 89:05.298
I have no idea. Oh, okay. I don't know. I'm going to have to look it up. Okay. I know the destination city in Italy is not one I recognize as being a major city. I went, yeah, this is going to take some time. Whatever.

Speaker 0 | 89:16.222
But it's 9-11 ST.

Speaker 1 | 89:16.963
It's 9-11 ST in Italy. It's going to be awesome. I'm surprised you turned it down. Fuck.

Speaker 0 | 89:22.845
I didn't turn it down. I know you didn't. I was committed elsewhere.

Speaker 1 | 89:25.386
I know you booked yourself.

Speaker 0 | 89:26.646
I keep my commitments, is what I do. If Nissan hadn't already bought the flight, maybe I would have backed out.

Speaker 1 | 89:34.149
Yeah. Well, we have a lot of launches coming up. The Brecci Car Show.

Speaker 0 | 89:38.671
Yeah. September 30th, Brekkie Car Club x WCCS x TST at the new location in the South Bay. And then of course, go to my Instagram and do the things to enter for the watch giveaway. One of one watch.
